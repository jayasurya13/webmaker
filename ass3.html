    <h1>Procedure</h1>
    <!-- creating ordered list for the preparation of chocolate cake-->
    <ol>
      <!--creating step 1 procedure-->
      
      <li><span>🎂</span>  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.
        Coat two 9-inch-round cake pans with cooking spray and line the bottoms with parchment paper.
      </li>
      <!--creating step 2 procedure-->
      <li><span>✌</span>
        Whisk the cocoa powder and 1 1/2 cups boiling water in a medium bowl <span>🥣</span>until smooth; set aside.
        Whisk the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda and salt in a large bowl until combined.
        Add the eggs<span>🥚</span>, vegetable oil, sour cream and vanilla and beat with a mixer on medium speed until smooth,
        about 1 minute. Reduce the mixer speed to low; beat in the cocoa mixture in a steady stream until just
        combined, then finish mixing with a rubber spatula. (The batter will be thin.)<span>💕</span>
      </li>
      <!--creating step 3 procedure-->
      <li><span>😃</span>
        Divide the batter between the prepared pans and tap the pans against the counter to help the
        batter settle. Bake until a toothpick inserted into the middle comes out clean, 30 to 40 minutes.
        Transfer to racks and let cool 10 minutes, then run a knife around the edge of the pans and turn 
        the cakes out onto the racks to cool completely. Remove the parchment. Trim the tops of the cakes
        with a long serrated knife to make them level, if desired<span>👏</span>
